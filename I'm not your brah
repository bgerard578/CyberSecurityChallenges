I ran a Google reverse image search on the image and switched it to visual match.
The third image () looks like the image so I click it, taking me to the site where I see it on google maps.
Based on the example flag, I assume that I am looking for a zoo.
I see that the location of the building is right nex to the Perth Zoo so I try that as the flag.

Flag:  etsuCTF{Perth_Zoo}
