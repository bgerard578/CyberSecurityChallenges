Scenario:
A mid-sized e-learn company "Knight Blog" recently detected suspicious network activity on their infrastructure. As the lead forensic analyst for the Knight Security Response Team, you've been called in to investigate. The IT team has provided you with three packet captures taken at different stages of what appears to be a coordinated cyber attack. Your mission is to analyze these captures, trace the attacker's footsteps, and uncover the full scope of the breach.

Question:
Our IDS flagged some suspicious scanning activity in the first capture. The attacker was probing our network to identify potential entry points. Analyze the traffic and determine how many ports were found to be open on the target system.
